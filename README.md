# SyncSystem Multiplatform Framework – Version: 0.8.9

## Goal:
Open source framework target at small, medium and large projects that needs a CMS (content management system) as base and unlimited features for e-commerce, user management, subscription management, among others.

The final goal would be to offer the framework in most of the popular programming languages and be able to host on any server – windows or linux, while sharing the same basic architecture, multiple database types and assets.

## Languages:
For now, it has a functional version that can be applied to small and medium projects in JavaScript, Node.JS, React (SSR – Server Side Rendering) and MySQL. The Ultimate goal would be to encompass the following technologies:
- NPM
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Node.JS
- React
- Next
- Redux
- GraphQL
- Vue
- Angular
- ESLint
- PHP
- Composer
- Laravel
- .NET (C#)
- MySQL
- SQL Serve
- MongoDB
- HTML5
- CSS3
- BootStrap

## Structure:
One of the main advantages is the ability to define features that will be available to each project by simply switching on and of the variables in the main configuration file. This enables the admin dashboard to be clean and without endless features that could confuse a conventional user.

Besides being built on modern programming architecture (APIs / microservices), it also has a type of structure that allows developers to build / attach new modules and database tables so that it can aggregate countless features, as long as it follows the main architecture.

Another core feature that was maintained since the second version, was the ability to define multiple “master page” template style structure.

## History:
This is the fourth version of the platform. It started with classic ASP / Access database, around 2007. The core architecture was maintained, with modules being able to be set by a main configuration file.

Later, it was transcribed to .NET / SQL Server and mixed with functional programming and object oriented programming.

Next, it was transcribed again to PHP / MySQL, maintaining functions, database architecture and building a “master page” style feature similar to the one found on the .NET framework forms.

Finally, it received its final version to update the architecture style, migrate to modern web programming languages, incorporate NoSQL database and integrate with testing frameworks for higher quality coding.
